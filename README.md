# LnknSplit
Split and merge files Lnkn
Sample code is in LnknSplit.py 

Splitter objects need to be given the complete path of the file to be split

Merger objects need to be given the complete path of the generated .head file

## Requirements 
You'll need to use the protobuf library found [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) if you want to use custom protocol buffers.
You can use Proto->split.proto as an template

I've tested the scripts on Python 3.6
